# 📝 Todo List Project
This project allows users to add, remove, and persist tasks in a to-do list. It provides a simple interface where users can type a task, 
add it to the list, and delete tasks as needed. The app uses the browser's localStorage to persist the list of tasks even when the page is reloaded or the browser is closed.

🛠 Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS (with custom properties and Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, LocalStorage)
- Google Fonts (Open Sans)

📁 Project Structure:
- `index.html`: The structure of the webpage, including an input field to add tasks and a button to trigger task creation.
- `css/style.css`: Contains styling for the page, including responsive design, button effects, and task item styling.
- `js/main.js`: Includes JavaScript logic to:
  - Add tasks to the list.
  - Remove tasks when the delete button is clicked.
  - Store tasks in `localStorage` so that they persist between page reloads.

⚡ Features:
- Add tasks to the list by typing in the input field and clicking "Add task" or pressing the Enter key.
- Remove tasks by clicking the "Delete" button next to each task.
- Tasks are saved in `localStorage`, ensuring they remain even after the page is reloaded.
- Simple, clean interface with a modern design using CSS for styling.

🚀 How to Run:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. You can start adding tasks, deleting them, and your list will be saved in the browser's localStorage.

Perfect for learning about DOM manipulation, event handling, and using `localStorage` to persist data in a web app. 📝🗑️
